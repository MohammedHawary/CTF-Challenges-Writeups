# Who are you?

## Description

Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn [http://mercury.picoctf.net:36622/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:36622/)

## HINTS

1. It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

> #### 100 points

## Approach

First I saw the weird message saying `Only people using the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!` and gif contain The phrase `Wait a minute, who are you?`

##### Let's solve this challenge in a question and answer method

**Question**:

Why does the author care who I am and how do sites know if I'm using a specific browser

**Answer**:

That's right through the `User-Agent` header, then I tried changing the `User-Agent` header with `PicoBrowser` and see what happens `User-Agent: PicoBrowser`.

**Changes**:

The message has been changed with a new message that says

> **I don't trust users who visit from another site.**

Question:

How do websites know if you came from another site or not

**Answer**:

I search about it and I found that there is a header called [Referer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer).

The `Referer` HTTP request header contains the absolute or partial address from which a resource has been requested. Then I added the `Referer` header with the same `host` header content

**Changes**:

The message was changed with

> **Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.**

Question:

How do sites know the date

**Answer**:

I search about it and I found that there is a header called [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date).

The `Date` general HTTP header contains the date and time at which the message originated. And from Google I know the syntax in which it writes `Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT`  then I added this header

**Changes**:

The message was changed with

> **I don't trust users who can be tracked.**

**Question**:

What is the name of the header that makes me untracked if I add it in the request

Let's use ChatGPT in this question

**Answer**:

The answer is [DNT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT) Then I added this header `DNT: 1`

**Changes**:

The message was changed with

> **This website is only for people from Sweden.**

**Question**:

How sites know the location of users

**Answer**:

I google it and I found that sites know location of users with range of IP address and I use [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header and search about sweden ip range and this IP address in the range `31.15.43.50` then the header wrote Like this `X-Forwarded-For: 31.15.43.50` then I added this header

**Changes**:

The message changed with

> **You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?**

**Question**:

How do sites know the language of the users

**Answer**:

I search about it and I found that there are a header called [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) and I asked ChatGPT to write Accept-Language header example for Sweden, and it answered with `Accept-Language: sv-SE` then I added this header

**Changes**:

I get the flag
